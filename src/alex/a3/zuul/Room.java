 * Class Room - a room in an adventure game.

 * This class is part of the "World of Zuul" application.
 * "World of Zuul" is a very simple, text based adventure game.
 *
 * A "Room" represents one location in the scenery of the game.  It is
 * connected to other rooms via exits.  The exits are labelled north,
 * east, south, west.  For each direction, the room stores a reference
 * to the neighboring room, or null if there is no exit in that direction.
